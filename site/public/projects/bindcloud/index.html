            <div class="post-content">
                <p>When I first started selfhosting, one of my earliest projects was to setup a custom DNS proxy. I landed on <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>,
a great option for self-hosting, that not only caches DNS queries for the network, but includes domain-blocking capabilities. With a trove
of publicly avaialable blocklists, it was the perfect solution.</p>
<p>However, after running the instance for a while, I decided to see if I could make it more secure, and more private. I soon learned about
DNS over https (DOH), and decided to implement it.</p>
<p>One of the most common solutions to this is to run <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/dns-over-https-client/"><code>cloudflared</code></a>. This solution is no longer well documented, but it does still work. Wanting to run in Docker, and finding that
the existing official container didn&rsquo;t seem to well support this (this is likely wrong, but I was very early in my selfhosting journey),
I decided, in my infinite wisdom, to create a simple custom Docker container to do the job.</p>
<p>So I did, and pointed my Pi-hole instance at cloudflared, and voila, fully proxied DNS!</p>
<p>This container remained in place for a few years until I decided to bring it into Kubernetes. At this point, there was no reason to re-tool
the solution, as my container had been working for years, but it was time to re-tool things. I moved the repo into my new Gitlab instance,
setup a pipeline, and implemented automated builds. The application now runs in a stack with a simple Bind instance that routes external
requests for Kubernetes resources to the Core-DNS instance that provides DNS to the cluster.</p>
